This package provides functions to compute time-varying quantiles [TVQs] and expectiles [TVEs] as in the work of Andrew Harvey and co-authors. 
Time-varying quantiles and time-varying expectiles capture the notion that features of the distribution other than the mean and the variance (GARCH and stochastic volatility models) can be dynamic, and as such, are parsilmoniously modeled using state space models.
